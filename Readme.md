# Project Title
Energy forecasting is the process of predicting future energy consumption, production, and demand patterns based on historical data, current trends, and various influencing factors. It plays a crucial role in energy management, resource allocation, infrastructure planning, and policy-making in both the public and private sectors.This notebook belongs to my participation in TechEnergy by Hitachi Energy, where I delved into the intricacies of energy forecasting. As I learned, energy forecasting serves as the cornerstone for predicting future energy consumption, production, and demand patterns. Drawing insights from historical data, current trends, and a multitude of influencing factors, it guides critical decisions in energy management, resource allocation, infrastructure planning, and policy-making across both public and private sectors.
